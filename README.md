# Linear Models

A model is a simplified representation of a more complex real-world system that helps us to better understand and analyse that system. A common type of model is the linear model, in which a dependent variable (or target) can be described by a linear combination of a set of independent variables (or features). This linear relationship makes it easy to derive and interpret the model, making it a basic and universal tool.

This repository tracks my recent notes on linear models. I will cover its derivation, interpretation, and variations.

The series of notes start with linear regression with only one parameter. With single parameter, it is relatively easy to show the big picture of least squares and optimization techniques. Then I will expand it to abstract (higher) dimensions using vector calculus. In the end, we can see a beautiful connection between these two dimensions.
